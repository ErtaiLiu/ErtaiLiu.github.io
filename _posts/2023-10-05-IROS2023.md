I am delighted to share that our research on visual navigation with automatic annotation has been accepted and presented at the IROS2023 conference in Detroit! I am sincerely grateful for the thoughtful questions and insightful comments I received both during and after the conference. If you have any interest in discussing this project or any of my other endeavors, please don't hesitate to reach outâ€”I'm more than happy to engage in conversation!
